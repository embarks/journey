[Erowid Note: 
While the author reported the substance used as 5-MeO-DMT, and references 5-MeO-DMT in the report, they seem to confuse NN-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. These substances have different effects and dosages. Most often the error made is that the term "DMT" is used to refer to 5-Methoxy-DMT. However, because of the ambiguity in the substance name, it is uncertain whether the author is speaking about 5-MeO-DMT throughout the report or not. See 5-MeO-DMT is Not "DMT".]



The Back story

Well it all started about 6 months ago, I was looking for a way to experience DMT and couldn't ever find any. I began researching and doing the necessary thing that any Psyconaut would do. During my research I ran into articles explaining how the Bufo Alvarius AKA Colorado River Toad produced 5-Meo-DMT and a couple other lovely substances. So I bought a couple of these awesome critters. I did not want to have an individual, but want two so they had some type of companionship. I respectively named the male Trippy Ricky and the Female Trippy Vicky Both making up the Psychedelic Relic. 

After purchasing these Toads I gave them adequate time to adapt to there surroundings. Handling them very limitedly and creating a mutual respect with them (btw these guys are ferocious eaters, they ate 36 crickets and 40 mill worms the 2nd day I had them). I then proceeded to milk the venom from their glands. As I milked them they seemed to be at peace, usually when I held them they tried to get out of my hands. But when I milked them they were very calm almost in such a way as they were being relieved; or they were willingly giving me there venom. 



Tripping time

(Wait a minute I need to take a hit of Venom Before I right this report)

So to start out I was trying to find the proper dose, like I do with any substance I always start out low and work my way up. At first I tried a very small piece and felt a slight head change but nothing extremely notable. As I gradually worked my way up I took about 3 match heads worth and chased the dragon. Instantly my heart started beating rapidly, my body was very heavy. Instantly my heart started beating rapidly, my body was very heavy. I then began to start vomiting (I think the vomiting occurred from anxiety though) When I lifted my head from a 5 gallon bucket I had lying beside the couch I was sitting on I had this very strong overwhelming feeling of oneness I cannot express in words. My body felt extremely heavy and all I could do was lay down for the first 2 minutes. I not only reached my threshold, pardon my French I was peaking like a mother F*****. I experienced very vibrant audible hallucinations and very minor visual. 



It got to the point where I had to step outside. I could hear everything and I mean everything going on all around me. From airplanes landing at a local airport to the crickets chirping and the birds tweeting. The trees had a slight melting affect but not nearly as great when I had experienced mescaline in the past. Also it was slightly euphoric but nothing in comparison to MDMA. It was a different kind of euphoria it was like a detachment from everyday worries and my nerve ending were in utter bliss. 



To me toad venom can best be described as more of a feeling than anything. It wasn�t super intense like I�ve read in other articles. I don�t know if it just has something to do with my biological make up or if I was just expecting something more intense like that next level that step up. But to me hands down the mescaline I have done in the past was a lot more intense. Although they both have their own positives. But to be completely truthful; I don�t do Psychedelics to see crazy things but to explore myself and to understand my true self without my ego getting in the way. I also like the mental clarity and understanding I have of what�s going on around for the short time after.
