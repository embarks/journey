[Erowid Note: 
While the author reported the substance used as 5-MeO-DMT, and references 5-MeO-DMT in the report, they seem to confuse NN-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT. These substances have different effects and dosages. Most often the error made is that the term "DMT" is used to refer to 5-Methoxy-DMT. However, because of the ambiguity in the substance name, it is uncertain whether the author is speaking about 5-MeO-DMT throughout the report or not. See 5-MeO-DMT is Not "DMT".]



[Reported Dose: "less than 1/4 gram of impure crystals DMT (possibly with bufotinine)"]



Just as a side note, I�ve always wanted to try DMT.  I�ve had widely varying results experimenting with Ayahuasca and Mimosahuasca, the last one being enough to make me hesitate in ever trying it again (I�m not going to go into details, let�s just say that it involved severe dehydration, a large quantity of expired syrian rue, and about 12 hours of delirius vomiting�).  I recently tried to extract some DMT out of Phalaris Arundinacaea (sp), but had to cut the experiment short due to meddling roommates.  I assumed that my dreams of elfspice would never reach fruition.  



Until about a month ago.  A friend called me up, and told me he might have something I�d like to try.  I headed over, and found him waiting for me with a meth pipe.  I asked what he had in mind, and he showed me a tiny bag of grey-white crystals.  He said that it was DMT, but not pure because it was only partly extracted from toad venom (I�m assuming Bufo).  He loaded some up and gave me the first hit.  I�m not exaggerating when I say I was literally floored.  The onset was immediate, and was like nothing I have ever tried.  It brings to mind the pan galactic gargle blaster from �The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy�.  Kind of like getting my brain bashed out with a golden brick, and shot into space.  It�s the mental equivalent of staring at the sun.  Definitely worth trying, and it only lasted about 30 sec. to a minute.  Afterwards, I bought as much as I could, and used it regularly over the next two weeks.  



The scariest part about it was that it seemed to get stronger the more I did it.  Like many have said before me, there is nothing that could prepare me for it.  I just had to throw myself at its mercy.
